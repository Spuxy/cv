about: '
  🔴 Interested in programming / software engineering. <br>
  🟠 Love to learn any subject about code from low level to high level. <br>
  🟡 Interested more in fundamental aspects than "just using" framework <br>
  🟢 My dream is to put my legacy into libraries/code which helps to other programmers
  🔵 Main factor is to have fun and see meaning of the project <br>
  🟤 I am looking for a team which communicates a lot with co-workers. <br>
  🔴 My picture of daily workflow is code reviewing and getting feedback and trying to figure out what to improve/avoid next time. <br>
  🟠 I am really motivated to improve myself and gain/drain knowledge from my co-workers. <br>
  🟡 I am able to see things from a different perspectives <br>
  🟢 My worklflow on processing to solve business problem (on code level): <br>
    🥇) Programming - get the thing done. <br>
    🥈) Engineering - debugging, refactoring, checking and creating "mental models" about code.<br>
