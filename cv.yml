about: '
  Hi, im Filip, im interested in programming / software engineering. I love learn all about code from low level to high level.
  If it makes sense i do my code to follow SOLID pattern. I like to do unit tests if makes sense for specific scenario. 

  Im looking for company which knows what it wants. My picture on a daily basis is code reviewing and getting feedback. 
  Im looking for a team whichs communicates a lot with co-workers.
